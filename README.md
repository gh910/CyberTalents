Hacker tried to hide information inside this binary file.

He is not good in remembering passwords (usually his passwords consists of 4 characters)

We were given a 64-bit ELF binary, I opened it in IDA.

Starting from the main function.. I noticed there were multiple random values being pushed to the stack


I thought it was our flag (or at least the encoded one) but I was wrong.

I searched this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures for 50 4B 03 04 and I found it, we got a zip file!

I dumped the values then used this https://tomeko.net/online_tools/hex_to_file.php to convert them.

I tried to extract it but it needed a password.

I tried to crack it using the famous rockyou.txt but it failed!!

I checked the description again, he said it's a 4-character password so I created my own wordlist.

I cracked it again and it worked and I got the flag :'D!

Hint: When you're creating the wordlist put into consideration:

The password might have repeated characters (e.g. xyzz), so the permutations function would lead you to nothing ;)


Don't forget to include the digits/numbers.
